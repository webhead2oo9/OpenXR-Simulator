## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- DirectX 11/12 or OpenGL compatible GPU

### Installation

1. Download the Windows ZIP from the [Releases](https://github.com/webhead2oo9/OpenXR-Simulator/releases) page.
2. Extract the entire ZIP to a permanent folder.
3. Double-click **Activate Simulator.cmd** and approve the administrator prompt.

```powershell
cd C:\Path\To\OpenXR-Simulator
.\activate_simulator.ps1
```

Keep the extracted files together and do not move the folder while the simulator
is active. The package includes the normal 64-bit runtime plus an x86 DLL and
manifest for 32-bit development tools. To launch a 32-bit application without
changing the machine-wide runtime, set `XR_RUNTIME_JSON` for that process to the
full path of `openxr_simulator-32.json`.

### Usage

Once registered, any OpenXR application will automatically use the simulator:

1. Launch your VR application (e.g., Unity project with OpenXR)
2. A desktop window will appear showing left/right eye views
3. Use the following controls:
   - **Mouse**: Look around (hold right-click)
   - **WASD**: Move forward/backward/strafe
   - **Q/E**: Move up/down
   - **Shift**: Hold to move faster
   - **, / .**: Slower/faster movement
   - **ESC**: Release mouse capture
   - **F3**: Show detailed XR p50/p95 frametime statistics in the title bar

### Uninstallation

To restore your previous OpenXR runtime:

```powershell
cd C:\Path\To\OpenXR-Simulator
.\deactivate_simulator.ps1
```

You can also double-click **Deactivate Simulator.cmd**.

## 🛠️ Building from Source

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/webhead2oo9/OpenXR-Simulator.git
cd OpenXR-Simulator
```

### Build with CMake

Building from source requires Visual Studio 2022 with the C++ toolchain, CMake
3.20 or later, and Vulkan headers (normally installed with the Vulkan SDK).

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build . --config Release
```

The built runtime will be in `bin/openxr_simulator.dll`.

### Release automation

GitHub Actions builds and tests both x64 and x86 for every push and pull request,
then assembles one ready-to-extract Windows ZIP containing both runtimes, portable
manifests, activation helpers, documentation, and the MCP server. To publish a
release, push a version tag such as `v1.6.0`; after validation passes, the workflow
uploads the ZIP and its SHA-256 checksum to a GitHub release with generated notes.

## 🔌 MCP Server

The bundled [MCP server](mcp-server/) exposes the simulator to LLM agents
(Claude Code, and any other Model Context Protocol client) for hands-free
testing, diagnosis, and driving of VR sessions:

- **Capture** — `capture_screenshot` (stereo or per-eye), `get_frame_info`,
  `get_projection_log`, `validate_stereo`
- **Diagnose** — `read_logs`, `get_diagnostics`, `diagnose_issue`,
  `get_session_state`, `get_head_tracking`, `clear_logs`
- **Flicker detection** — `get_flicker_status`, `capture_flicker_window`,
  `get_ui_flicker_status`, `capture_ui_flicker_window` (returns incident
  contact sheets an agent can review visually)
- **Control** — `set_head_pose`, `set_fov`, `set_ipd`, `set_headset_profile`,
  `enable_anaglyph_preview`, `enable_pose_sweep`

Quick start:

```bash
cd mcp-server
pip install -e .
python openxr_simulator_mcp.py
```

Point your MCP client at the script (e.g. for Claude Code):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openxr-simulator": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["path/to/mcp-server/openxr_simulator_mcp.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

See the [MCP server README](mcp-server/README.md) for full tool documentation.

## 📖 Technical Details

### Architecture

The simulator implements the OpenXR runtime interface, intercepting all OpenXR calls from applications:

- **Instance & Session Management** - Handles OpenXR instance creation and session lifecycle
- **Swapchain Rendering** - Creates swapchains for D3D11, D3D12, and OpenGL that applications render into
- **View Composition** - Blits stereo views to a desktop window (D3D11: DXGI swapchain, D3D12: GPU downscale to window size then readback, OpenGL: pixel buffer readback)
- **Input Simulation** - Converts mouse/keyboard input to head pose and controller data

### Supported Features

- ✅ Core OpenXR 1.0 specification
- ✅ D3D11 graphics binding (`XR_KHR_D3D11_enable`)
- ✅ D3D12 graphics binding (`XR_KHR_D3D12_enable`)
- ✅ Vulkan graphics binding (`XR_KHR_vulkan_enable` and `XR_KHR_vulkan_enable2`)
- ✅ OpenGL graphics binding (`XR_KHR_opengl_enable`)
- ✅ Win32 time conversion (`XR_KHR_win32_convert_performance_counter_time`)
- ✅ Multiple swapchain formats (sRGB, UNORM, HDR, typeless, depth)
- ✅ Mutable format swapchains (typeless backing for sRGB/non-sRGB views)
- ✅ Stereo rendering with configurable FOV
- ✅ Reference space tracking (LOCAL, STAGE, VIEW)
- ✅ Basic action system for input
- ✅ Screenshot capture (D3D11, D3D12, and OpenGL)

### Vulkan sessions

The compositor is D3D12 whatever the app binds. A Vulkan session's swapchain images are
D3D12 committed resources created `SHARED`, imported into the app's own `VkDevice` through
`VK_EXTERNAL_MEMORY_HANDLE_TYPE_D3D12_RESOURCE_BIT`, and handed back as `VkImage`s — so the
app renders in Vulkan and the preview, quad layers, screenshots and burst capture read the
same pixels as `ID3D12Resource`s with no second code path. `xrGetVulkanGraphicsDevice2KHR`
returns the `VkPhysicalDevice` whose `deviceLUID` matches the DXGI adapter the compositor
runs on, which is what makes the shared-handle import legal.

`xrEnumerateSwapchainFormats` reports `VkFormat` values under a Vulkan session. Images are
handed over in `VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL` (depth:
`VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_DEPTH_STENCIL_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL`) and must be released in the same layout,
as the spec requires — an app renders straight into an acquired image with no barrier of its
own, so the runtime owes it that layout and never changes it afterwards.

The app's `VkQueue` and the compositor's D3D12 queue are ordered by one shared `ID3D12Fence`
imported as a timeline `VkSemaphore`, driven by a single strictly increasing counter that
each side signals in turn. `SIMXR_VK_NO_TIMELINE=1` falls back to CPU waits, which is correct
but serialises the frame — useful when a driver's timeline import misbehaves.

Colour resources carry `D3D12_RESOURCE_FLAG_ALLOW_SIMULTANEOUS_ACCESS` (no DCC, so the bytes
Vulkan wrote are readable through a D3D12 SRV), depth uses a typeless DXGI format, and both
set `D3D12_DEFAULT_RESOURCE_PLACEMENT_ALIGNMENT` explicitly. Those three come from BetterVR's
own Vulkan/D3D12 bridge and are there for AMD.

### Limitations

- ❌ No hand tracking
- ❌ No haptic feedback
- ❌ No foveated rendering
- ❌ Limited to seated/standing experiences

## 🎮 Configuration

Settings are changed from the menu bar and persist across restarts in
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenXR-Simulator\settings.json`. Delete the file to go back to
defaults.

### Headset Profiles

Pick a headset from **FOV → Headset Profile** to preset the per-eye frustum,
physical panel shape, and a nominal IPD. The values are measured ones from the
[HMD Geometry Database](https://risa2000.github.io/hmdgdb/). Add a profile by
appending a row to `ui::kHeadsetSpecs` in
[ui_enhancements.h](src/ui_enhancements.h); the enum, menu and settings keys
follow from the table.

### Render Resolution

**Tools → Render Resolution** independently chooses the per-eye size reported to
`xrEnumerateViewConfigurationViews`. The default is **1280x1400 (Performance)**;
**Headset Native** uses the active profile's panel size, while the other presets
trade image quality for GPU cost. Restart the OpenXR application after changing
this setting so it recreates its color and depth swapchains.

For an exact custom size, set `render_width` and `render_height` in
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenXR-Simulator\settings.json` while the application is closed.
Values are clamped to the runtime's 4096x4096 maximum; `0` for both selects the
active headset's native panel resolution.

Render resolution does not determine desktop-preview size. **Zoom → Fill Window**
(or `F`) scales lower-resolution images up and supersampled images down to cover
the entire preview client area. Maximizing the window keeps it maximized instead
of forcing it back to the headset aspect ratio. The numbered zoom modes remain
available for pixel inspection.

### Movement Speed

WASD/QE move the head at 3 m/s by default, and holding **Shift** multiplies that
by 4. Both numbers are set from **Tools → Movement Speed**: presets from 0.5 to
10 m/s, `,` and `.` to step off them, and a submenu for the Shift multiplier.

### Mirror Rate

The preview window is a mirror of what the headset would show, and drawing it costs
the app a little time on every frame it updates. **Tools → Mirror Rate** caps how
often that happens: **60 Hz** by default, or 30/15 Hz, **Every Frame**, or **Off** to
freeze the mirror entirely while the application keeps running normally. Lower is
cheaper — turning it off leaves the runtime costing essentially nothing per frame,
which is worth doing while profiling the application itself. It applies to every
backend, and a screenshot request always forces a fresh frame through regardless of
the setting.

### Window Size

The preview remembers its client size. In **Fill Window** mode it accepts any
window or monitor aspect and scales the image to every client pixel; manual zoom
modes keep the headset-content aspect for predictable pixel inspection.

### Background Color

The preview window background can be customized:

```cpp
const float clearColor[4] = {0.1f, 0.1f, 0.2f, 1.0f}; // Dark blue
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Application doesn't use the simulator

1. Verify registration:
```powershell
Get-Content "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\openxr\1\active_runtime.json"
```

2. Check for conflicting API layers:
```powershell
reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Khronos\OpenXR\1\ApiLayers\Implicit"
```

3. Ensure no other VR runtime is running (SteamVR, Oculus, etc.)

### Colors appear washed out

- Disable any OpenXR API layers that modify rendering
- Ensure your application uses sRGB swapchain formats
- Check that no post-processing is double-applying gamma

### Preview window doesn't appear

- Check the log file: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenXR-Simulator\openxr_simulator.log`
- Verify D3D11/D3D12/OpenGL support on your system
- Try running the application as administrator

### D3D12 applications crash or show stack overflow

- This is typically caused by DXGI Present hook conflicts with Steam overlay or UEVR. The simulator uses GDI-based rendering for D3D12 to avoid this, so make sure you're on the latest version.

### Performance issues

- Turn **Tools → Mirror Rate** down, or **Off**. Mirroring the eyes to the window is
  the only per-frame work the runtime does that scales with resolution.
- Leave `SIMXR_VERBOSE` unset. Setting it makes the runtime log every frame, and each
  line is flushed to disk — useful when diagnosing a frame, expensive as a default.
- Reduce swapchain resolution in your application
- Disable MSAA if enabled
- Close other GPU-intensive applications
